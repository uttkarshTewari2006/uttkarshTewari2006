# 👋 Hi there! I’m Uttkarsh Tewari  

I’m a junior **Computer Science major at the University of California, Santa Cruz (GPA 3.93)** passionate about building impactful software that blends **AI intelligence** with **clean, scalable engineering**.

---

## 🔧 What I Build  
- **Full-stack web applications:** JavaScript, React, Next.js, Tailwind, Firebase, Flask  
- **AI and ML pipelines:** Python, NumPy, Pandas — with custom implementations of models *built from scratch without Scikit-learn*  
- **Open-ended innovation:** From product design to deployment, I focus on usability, performance, and clean architecture
